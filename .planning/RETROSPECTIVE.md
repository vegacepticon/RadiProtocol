## Milestone: v1.0 — Community Plugin Release

**Shipped:** 2026-04-07  
**Phases:** 7 | **Plans:** 28 | **Timeline:** 3 days (2026-04-05 → 2026-04-07)

### What Was Built

- Complete Obsidian plugin scaffold: TypeScript + esbuild + Vitest + ESLint (23 obsidianmd rules), zero warnings
- Pure traversal state machine (ProtocolRunner) with discriminated union, snapshot undo, and full loop context stack
- End-to-end RunnerView ItemView: live preview, all 7 node types rendered, copy/save output, start-from-node picker
- Canvas Node Editor side panel: per-node forms for all 7 kinds, write-back with canvas-closed guard, context menu integration
- Snippet system: full CRUD, 4 placeholder types, fill-in modal with live preview, WriteMutex per-file locking
- Loop support: loop-start/loop-end parsing + validation, multi-iteration tracking, undo across loop boundaries, UI with iteration label
- Mid-session persistence: auto-save after every step, resume detection with mtime check, snippet content snapshot, onLayoutReady deferral

### What Worked

- **Wave-based plan structure** (Wave 0 = RED stubs, Wave N = GREEN implementation) made every plan verifiable before the next began — zero blind spots
- **Pure engine modules** with no Obsidian imports paid off immediately: fast Vitest loops, no mocking overhead
- **Human UAT checkpoint per phase** caught real bugs (startup hang, missing auto-save triggers, readonly textarea) before they compounded
- **Snapshot undo** was the right call — simpler than diffs and handles all edge cases including loop boundaries
- **Strategy A** (require canvas closed for write-back) resolved the highest-risk Phase 4 decision cleanly without undocumented API fragility
- **WriteMutex** caught a real race condition in Phase 7 code review — the pattern was worth establishing in Phase 5

### What Was Inefficient

- ROADMAP.md progress table was not updated by executor for phases 1, 3, 5, 7 — required manual fix at milestone completion
- REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table remained mostly "Pending" throughout — was never updated incrementally; required full update at milestone close
- Phase 6 had no `06-03-PLAN.md` (plan file was missing, but SUMMARY was created) — minor planning artifact gap

### Patterns Established

- `radiprotocol_*` property namespace on canvas nodes — never collides with Obsidian native fields
- `WriteMutex` per file path using `async-mutex` — required for any feature with concurrent `vault.modify()` calls
- `onLayoutReady` deferral for any plugin UI that reads workspace state at startup
- `Set` → `Array` serialization before `JSON.stringify()` — any serialized state must convert all `Set` fields
- Snapshot undo stack pattern: push full `{currentNodeId, accumulatedText, loopContextStack}` snapshot per UndoEntry

### Key Lessons

1. **Plan the undo model before touching the loop engine** — loop context stack must be snapshotted in UndoEntry or step-back produces silent cross-boundary failures
2. **Session restore must be deferred to `onLayoutReady`** — plugin `onload()` fires before the workspace is ready; calling `getLeaf()` there hangs startup
3. **`vault.adapter.remove()` not `vault.delete()`** for session file deletion — path normalisation differences caused test failures when using the wrong API
4. **Human UAT per phase is non-negotiable** for UI phases — automated tests don't catch DOM ordering bugs or missing event wire-ups

### Cost Observations

- Model mix: quality profile (Sonnet 4.6 primary throughout)
- Sessions: ~8 sessions over 3 days
- Notable: Parallel wave execution in Phases 5–7 (multiple plans per wave) significantly reduced total session count

## Cross-Milestone Trends

### Process Evolution

| Milestone | Phases | Plans | Key Change |
|-----------|--------|-------|------------|
| v1.0 | 7 | 28 | First milestone — baseline established |

### Cumulative Quality

| Milestone | Tests | Zero-Dep Engine Modules |
|-----------|-------|------------------------|
| v1.0 | 28+ passing | parser, runner, snippets, sessions |

### Top Lessons (Verified Across Milestones)

1. Human UAT checkpoint per UI phase catches bugs that automated tests miss
2. Pure engine modules (zero Obsidian imports) make the test loop fast and reliable — worth the upfront discipline
