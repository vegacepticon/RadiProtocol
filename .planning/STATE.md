# RadiProtocol — Project State

**Updated:** 2026-04-25
**Milestone:** v1.10 Editor Sync & Runner UX Polish
**Status:** Phase 65 Plan 01 complete — RED Vitest coverage now locks RUNNER-02 footer row placement and visible Back/Skip labels across RunnerView and InlineRunnerModal. Focused command intentionally fails against current implementation; next action is 65-02 implementation to turn these tests GREEN.

---

## Current Position

Phase: 65 (in progress — 1/2 plans complete)
Plan: 65-01 complete → next 65-02
Status: RED coverage complete. `src/__tests__/views/runner-footer-layout.test.ts` asserts mixed answer/snippet DOM order, footer row class, visible `Back`/`Skip`, RunnerView click prologue, and inline parity. Next action: execute 65-02 implementation.
Last activity: 2026-04-25 — Plan 65-01 shipped (commits 3c16e4e, 75db900) + 65-01-SUMMARY.md

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-04-25 — v1.10 milestone added).
See: `.planning/ROADMAP.md` (updated 2026-04-25 — v1.10 phase details appended).
See: `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (updated 2026-04-25 — traceability populated, 9/9 mapped).

**Core value:** A radiologist can generate a structured, accurate protocol in seconds by answering a guided algorithm — without writing a single line of code.

**Current focus:** v1.10 — close accumulated UX regressions (step-back reliability, scroll preservation, Skip/Back layout, auto-grow textareas), introduce bidirectional canvas ↔ Node Editor sync, fix Snippet branch label sync to edge, and add Inline Runner resizable modal + file-bound snippet parity.

---

## v1.10 Phase Plan

| Phase | Name | Requirements | Depends on |
|-------|------|--------------|------------|
| 63 | Bidirectional Canvas ↔ Node Editor Sync | EDITOR-03, EDITOR-05 | Nothing |
| 64 | Node Editor Polish — Auto-grow & Text Block Quick-Create | EDITOR-04, EDITOR-06 | Phase 63 (advisory) |
| 65 | Runner Footer Layout — Back/Skip Row | RUNNER-02 | Nothing |
| 66 | Runner Step-Back Reliability & Scroll Pinning | RUNNER-03, RUNNER-04 | Nothing (advisory: after Phase 63) |
| 67 | Inline Runner Resizable Modal & File-Bound Snippet Parity | INLINE-FIX-06, INLINE-FIX-07 | Nothing |

**Parallelizability:**
- Phase 63 (Node Editor sync) ‖ Phase 65 (Runner footer) ‖ Phase 67 (Inline Runner) — independent file scopes
- Phase 64 follows Phase 63 (advisory — shared textarea init code)
- Phase 66 advisory after Phase 63 (canvas-sync events would muddy step-back debugging if interleaved)

**Coverage:** 9/9 v1.10 requirements mapped; 0 unmapped, 0 duplicates.

## Accumulated Context

### v1.0–v1.9 Shipped

- v1.0 (7 phases): foundation — parser, runner, UI, editor panel, snippets, loops, sessions.
- v1.2 (8 phases): runner UX and bug fixes (layout, selectors, separators, read-back).
- v1.3 (1 phase): interactive placeholder chip editor.
- v1.4 (4 phases): auto node coloring, snippet node (8th kind), mixed answer+snippet branching.
- v1.5 (4 phases): snippet editor refactoring (tree UI, modal create/edit, DnD, rename, MD snippets in runner).
- v1.6 (7 phases): dead-code audit, canvas node creation, node duplication, live canvas update.
- v1.7 (4 phases): unified loop node, runtime picker, editor form + picker-modal + start-from-node command, free-text-input removal.
- v1.8 (14 phases, 47–58): runner regressions closed, Node Editor UX polish, edge semantics (`+`-prefix exit, Answer↔edge sync), snippet picker overhaul + file-binding + button UX reversal, JSON placeholders → 2 types, Skip/Close buttons, Inline Protocol Display Mode, BRAT distribution (GitHub Release v1.8.0).
- v1.9 (4 phases, 59–62): Inline Runner feature parity (nested path resolution, separator on snippet insert, JSON fill-in modal), position persistence + compact layout, folder autocomplete on settings path fields, BRAT Release v1.9.0.

### Standing Pitfalls (carry-over from v1.9)

1. Never modify `.canvas` while open in Canvas view (Strategy A) unless Pattern B live-editor is used.
2. `vault.modify()` race conditions — use `WriteMutex` (async-mutex) per file path.
3. No `innerHTML` — use DOM API and Obsidian helpers.
4. No `require('fs')` — use `app.vault.*` exclusively.
5. `loadData()` returns null on first install — always merge with defaults.
6. `console.log` forbidden in production — use `console.debug()` during dev.
7. CSS files are append-only per phase — edit only the relevant feature file in `src/styles/`.
8. Shared files (`main.ts`, `editor-panel-view.ts`, `snippet-manager-view.ts`) — only modify code relevant to the current phase.
9. Real-DOM vs mock-DOM parent lookup: `parentElement` first, `.parent` mock fallback second.
10. v1.7 excised `maxIterations` — do not reintroduce a per-loop or global iteration cap.
11. v1.8: preserve backward compatibility of stored canvas shape — directory-bound Snippet nodes must keep working unchanged.
12. v1.9: Inline Runner position persistence uses clamp-on-restore (not clamp-on-save) — resize persistence in v1.10 (Phase 67) must follow same pattern to survive monitor/resolution changes.

### v1.10-relevant precedents

- **Phase 50 — Answer ↔ edge label sync**: bidirectional binding pattern for the EDITOR-03 Snippet branch-label ↔ outgoing edge label work in Phase 63.
- **Phase 38/41 — Pattern B canvas live editor**: write-back on open canvases; canvas → form direction in Phase 63 (EDITOR-05) will subscribe to the same canvas-node-change event surface.
- **Phase 48 (NODEUI-04) — Question textarea auto-grow**: reference behaviour to extend across all multi-line fields in Phase 64 (EDITOR-04).
- **Phase 39 / 42 — quick-create button infrastructure**: `CanvasNodeFactory` + `flex-wrap: wrap` toolbar — Phase 64 (EDITOR-06) adds a fifth button using the established pattern.
- **Phase 60 — Inline Runner position persistence**: workspace-state contract + clamp-on-restore — Phase 67 (INLINE-FIX-06) adds width/height persistence on the same contract.
- **Phase 56 — file-bound Snippet button click → direct insert**: sidebar parity that Phase 67 (INLINE-FIX-07) replicates in inline mode.
- **Phase 53 (RUNNER-SKIP-01..03) — Skip button**: existing Skip implementation that Phase 65 (RUNNER-02) repositions next to Back.

### Open Tech Debt (deferred to future)

- 3 Nyquist VALIDATION.md gaps (Phase 43/44/46 — tests green, frontmatter not promoted) — carried from v1.7.
- Nyquist VALIDATION.md draft for phases 12–19, 28–31, 32–35, 36–42.
- 1 legacy debug session (phase-27-regressions — `awaiting_human_verify`) — carried from v1.7.
- `@deprecated` `LoopStartNode` / `LoopEndNode` retained for Migration Check enumeration.
- 14+ stale todo files for v1.6–v1.9-delivered work in `.planning/todos/pending/` — cleanup opportunistically.
- 2 stale seeds (`duplicate-node.md`, `quick-node-creation.md`) for v1.6-delivered work in `.planning/seeds/`.

| Category | Item | Status | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| debug | phase-27-regressions | awaiting_human_verify | v1.7 carryover — color regression root cause found in canvas-live-editor.ts PROTECTED_FIELDS; not blocking |
| uat | Phase 59 UAT status field | passed / 0 open | Auditor noise — 0 pending scenarios, phase verified green |
| uat | Phase 61 UAT status field | unknown / 0 open | Status-field oversight — 0 pending scenarios, phase shipped |
| todo | 14+ stale todo files (mixed) | mixed | Most reference already-delivered v1.6–v1.9 work; opportunistic cleanup |

**Triage outcome:** All non-blocking for v1.10. No hard prerequisites.
