# RadiProtocol — Project State

**Updated:** 2026-04-21
**Milestone:** v1.8 — UX Polish & Snippet Picker Overhaul
**Status:** Phase 55 complete at plan level; phase-level orchestrator gates (regression / code-review / verify_phase_goal) pending on several phases.

> **Note (2026-04-21):** Per-plan executive log trimmed to one-line references after forensic report `.planning/forensics/report-20260421-140424.md` identified STATE.md bloat as primary driver of GSD-command token cost. Full historical log preserved in `.planning/STATE.archive-2026-04-21.md`. Per-plan details always live in `{phase}-{plan}-SUMMARY.md`; per-phase gate details in `{phase}-UAT.md` / `{phase}-VALIDATION.md` / `{phase}-VERIFICATION.md`. Use `git log --oneline` for commit timeline.

## Current Position

**Active milestone:** v1.8 (85% complete — 34/40 plans across 15 phases).

**Most recent work (2026-04-21):**
- **Phase 57 — REQUIREMENTS Traceability Refresh (GAP CLOSURE)** — ✅ Complete (docs-only). Single atomic commit: INLINE-01..05 promoted, 11 stale checkboxes flipped, Coverage Summary added. Unblocks Phase 58 (which authors missing VERIFICATION.md files and cites INLINE-01..05).
- **Phase 55 — BRAT Distribution Readiness** — ✅ Complete. 4 plans + UAT PASS 7/7. BRAT-01 fully closed — GitHub Release v1.8.0 published by user via web-UI on 2026-04-21; SC-2/SC-3 verified. See `55-04-SUMMARY.md`.
- **Phase 54 — Inline Protocol Display Mode** — ✅ Complete (plan-level). 4 plans + 3 UAT fix rounds + post-landing code-review fix cycle (CR-01/CR-02, WR-01..WR-05). See `54-REVIEW-FIX.md`.
- **Phase 56 — Snippet Button UX Reversal** — ✅ Complete (plan-level). 4 plans + UAT PASS 5/5. Overturned Phase 51 D-13 (auto-insert on single-edge file-bound Snippet) and D-16 (sibling-button routes through picker). New rule: file-bound Snippet = direct insert (or placeholder modal for `.json`); directory-bound = picker. See `56-04-SUMMARY.md`.

**Still pending orchestrator phase-level gates** (regression / code-review / verify_phase_goal): multiple phases from 47 onwards landed at plan-level but haven't run the phase-complete pipeline. See individual SUMMARY files for exact state.

**Note on v1.8 Phase Map (below) and ROADMAP Progress section:** Both are stale — ROADMAP still lists Phase 51 as "0/6 Planned" and Phase 53 as "1/4 In progress", but git log shows 51/52/53/54/55/56 all shipped at plan level. Update those tables as part of next milestone closure.

**Core value:** A radiologist can generate a structured, accurate protocol in seconds by answering a guided algorithm — without writing a single line of code.

## Accumulated Context

### v1.0–v1.7 Shipped

- v1.0 (7 phases): foundation — parser, runner, UI, editor panel, snippets, loops, sessions.
- v1.2 (8 phases): runner UX and bug fixes (layout, selectors, separators, read-back).
- v1.3 (1 phase): interactive placeholder chip editor.
- v1.4 (4 phases): auto node coloring, snippet node (8th kind), mixed answer+snippet branching.
- v1.5 (4 phases): snippet editor refactoring (tree UI, modal create/edit, DnD, rename, MD snippets in runner).
- v1.6 (7 phases): dead-code audit, canvas node creation, node duplication, live canvas update.
- v1.7 (4 phases): unified loop node, runtime picker, editor form + picker-modal + start-from-node command, free-text-input removal.

### v1.8 Roadmap Evolution

- **Phase 48.1** inserted after 48 — Toolbar Gap Tighten (cosmetic UAT follow-up). (URGENT)
- **Phase 50.1** inserted after 50 — Loop Exit `+` Prefix Convention. Supersedes Phase 49 D-07 alias so loop nodes can carry multiple labeled body edges unambiguously. Originated from conflict surfaced during Phase 50 UAT. (URGENT)
- **Phase 54** added mid-milestone — Inline Protocol Display Mode (third Runner display mode). Locked via `/gsd-explore` 2026-04-20, 4 decisions in `.planning/notes/inline-protocol-mode.md`.
- **Phase 56** added to v1.8 — Snippet Button UX Reversal. Overturns Phase 51 D-13/D-16 per user UAT verdict (2026-04-20).

### v1.8 Design Decisions (locked during /gsd-explore on 2026-04-18)

1. **Loop exit edge convention** — one labeled edge among loop-node outgoing = exit-button caption; unlabeled = body. (Originally "exactly one labeled"; Phase 50.1 relaxed to `+`-prefix convention.) See `.planning/notes/loop-node-exit-edge-convention.md`.
2. **Answer displayLabel ↔ edge label sync is bi-directional** — `Answer.displayLabel` is source of truth; multi-incoming shares label (accepted trade-off). See `.planning/notes/answer-label-edge-sync.md`.
3. **Snippet node binding** — node binds to a directory (existing) or specific snippet file (new). **Post-Phase-56 rule:** file-bound Snippet always renders a button + click = direct insert (or placeholder modal for `.json` with placeholders); directory-bound = button→picker. See `.planning/notes/snippet-node-binding-and-picker.md`.
4. **Hierarchical snippet picker with search** — unified picker replaces flat folder list; folder drill-down, breadcrumb, tree-wide search.
5. **JSON snippet placeholder types** — collapsed to `free-text` + unified `choice`. `choice` always multi-select in UI; single pick inserts one value, multi pick joins by separator (default `", "`, per-placeholder override). `number` / `multichoice` removed. Hard validation error on legacy types. See `.planning/notes/json-snippet-placeholder-rework.md`.
6. **BRAT distribution requires GitHub Releases with assets** — manifest must align with release tags; `manifest.json` / `main.js` / `styles.css` attached as assets.
7. **Inline protocol display mode (Phase 54)** — third Runner mode; floating non-blocking modal, appends answers to end of source note; command-palette launch only. See `.planning/notes/inline-protocol-mode.md`.

### Standing Pitfalls

1. Never modify `.canvas` while open in Canvas view (Strategy A) unless Pattern B live-editor is used.
2. `vault.modify()` race conditions — use `WriteMutex` (async-mutex) per file path.
3. No `innerHTML` — use DOM API and Obsidian helpers.
4. No `require('fs')` — use `app.vault.*` exclusively.
5. `loadData()` returns null on first install — always merge with defaults.
6. `console.log` forbidden in production — use `console.debug()` during dev.
7. CSS files are append-only per phase — edit only the relevant feature file in `src/styles/`.
8. Shared files (`main.ts`, `editor-panel-view.ts`, `snippet-manager-view.ts`) — only modify code relevant to the current phase.
9. Real-DOM vs mock-DOM parent lookup: `parentElement` first, `.parent` mock fallback second.
10. v1.7 excised `maxIterations` — do not reintroduce a per-loop or global iteration cap in v1.8.
11. v1.8: preserve backward compatibility of stored canvas shape — directory-bound Snippet nodes must keep working unchanged when specific-snippet binding is added.

### Open Tech Debt Carried Over from v1.7

- 3 Nyquist VALIDATION.md gaps (Phase 43/44/46 — tests green, frontmatter not promoted).
- 2 stale verification frontmatters (Phase 44/45 — UAT completed, frontmatter `human_needed`).
- 1 legacy debug session (phase-27-regressions — `awaiting_human_verify`).
- 6 code-review informational items (43-REVIEW WR-02/WR-03, 45-REVIEW IN-01/IN-02, 46-REVIEW IN-01/IN-02).
- `@deprecated` `LoopStartNode` / `LoopEndNode` retained for Migration Check enumeration.
- Nyquist VALIDATION.md draft for phases 12–19, 28–31, 32–35, 36–42.

Non-blocking for v1.8 delivery; clean up opportunistically during relevant phases.

### Open v1.8 tracking hygiene

- `ROADMAP.md § Progress` rows for Phases 51/52/53/54/55/56 are stale (show "Planned"/"In progress"/"Not started" for plans that already shipped). Refresh on milestone closure.
- 4 untracked `.planning/phases/*/*.md` files in `git status` (51-HUMAN-UAT, 53-PATTERNS, 54-CONTEXT, 54-REVIEW). Decide whether to commit or remove.
