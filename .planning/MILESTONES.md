# Milestones

## v1.6 Polish & Canvas Workflow (Shipped: 2026-04-17)

**Phases completed:** 7 phases, 14 plans, 21 tasks

**Key accomplishments:**

- Knip-driven dead code removal: 8 unused type exports internalized, 2 dead files deleted, 3 legend CSS rules removed, 3 RED test stubs removed, async-mutex dependency restored
- CSS flex gap fix for snippet create/edit modal type row -- "ТипJSON" now renders as "Тип JSON"
- One-liner:
- 150ms async delay between createNode and loadNode to prevent stale canvas JSON reads after requestSave
- Duplicate node button in editor panel toolbar with radiprotocol property preservation and live canvas data read
- renderNodeForm now falls back to live canvas state when Obsidian's debounced save hasn't flushed yet, and empty-type nodes show the "Select a node type to configure this node" hint locked by the UI-SPEC.
- Third quick-create button 'Create snippet node' added to the node editor toolbar (Lucide file-text icon, accent styling matching Phase 39 buttons) — reuses onQuickCreate by widening its kind union to include 'snippet', zero new pipeline code.
- UAT gap 1 closed — attachCanvasListener now defers the canvas.selection read via setTimeout(0) and wires both 'click' and 'dblclick' on the canvas container, so double-clicking empty canvas space auto-loads the freshly-created node into the Node Editor without the prior click-off-then-click-on detour.
- UAT gap 2 closed — `.rp-editor-create-toolbar` now wraps its four quick-create buttons onto a second row when the Node Editor sidebar is narrowed below the four-button row width, keeping the right-most "Duplicate node" button reachable at every sidebar width.

## v1.5 Snippet Editor Refactoring (Shipped: 2026-04-16)

**Phases completed:** 4 phases (32–35), 18 plans
**Timeline:** 2026-04-15 → 2026-04-16 (2 days)
**Git:** 73 commits, 90 files changed, +19518/-1034 LOC

**Key accomplishments:**

- Phase 32: SnippetService refactored — `Snippet = JsonSnippet | MdSnippet` discriminated union, `listFolder`/`load`/`save`/`delete` extension routing, `vault.trash()` delete, `rewriteCanvasRefs` vault-wide canvas reference sync utility with WriteMutex (MD-05, DEL-01)
- Phase 33: SnippetManagerView rewritten as recursive folder tree — SnippetEditorModal (unified create/edit, JSON↔MD toggle, folder dropdown, D-09 move-on-save pipeline, unsaved-changes guard), folder CRUD (create/delete with contents listing), vault watcher (create/delete/rename events with 120ms debounce + prefix filter) — 20 requirements satisfied (TREE-01..04, MODAL-01..08, FOLDER-01..03, SYNC-01..03, DEL-02..03)
- Phase 34: Drag-and-drop + context menu "Move to…" + modal folder field for snippet/folder reorganization; F2/context-menu inline rename for files and folders; all move/rename operations auto-rewrite SnippetNode `subfolderPath` in every Canvas via `rewriteCanvasRefs` — UAT approved by Роман (MOVE-01..05, RENAME-01..03)
- Phase 35: `.md` snippets in Protocol Runner picker with glyph prefix differentiation; click-to-insert inserts content verbatim without fill-in modal; works in subfolder drill-down and mixed answer+snippet branching — 7/7 verification truths passed (MD-01..04)
- All 34 v1.5 requirements satisfied; milestone audit passed with tech_debt status (no blockers); 5/5 cross-phase E2E flows verified; 20/20 integration points connected
- Known deferred items: Node Editor stale subfolderPath display (cosmetic), chip editor English labels (Phase 27 legacy), 3 Phase 26 RED test stubs, Nyquist validation draft for all 4 phases

## v1.4 Snippets and Colors, Colors and Snippets (Shipped: 2026-04-15)

**Phases completed:** 4 phases (28–31), 12 plans
**Timeline:** 2026-04-13 → 2026-04-15 (3 days)
**Git:** 54 commits, 66 files changed, +8753/-110 LOC (`46656af` → `d6c6280`)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Phase 28: Auto node coloring — single injection point in `saveNodeEdits` writes the correct canvas color on every save across both Pattern B (canvas open) and Strategy A (canvas closed) paths; test helper `makeCanvasNode` auto-derives color from `radiprotocol_nodeType` (NODE-COLOR-01/02/03)
- Phase 29: Snippet node model — 8th node kind in discriminated union; canvas-parser recognizes `radiprotocol_nodeType = "snippet"`; graph-validator warns on missing subfolder path; EditorPanel form with BFS-based subfolder picker under `.radiprotocol/snippets/` (SNIPPET-NODE-01/02/08)
- Phase 30: Runner snippet integration — new `awaiting-snippet-pick` runner state, `ProtocolRunner.pickSnippet()` routing into the existing fill-in flow, session serialize/restore support, `SnippetService.listFolder` with pre-I/O path-safety gate (rejects `..`, absolute paths, sibling-prefix matches), RunnerView picker with subfolder drill-down (SNIPPET-NODE-03/04/05/06/07)
- Phase 31: Mixed answer + snippet branching — question nodes can route to both answer and snippet nodes simultaneously; `chooseSnippetBranch` runner API with undo-before-mutate and `returnToBranchList` flag; per-node `snippetLabel` + separator override editable in Node Editor; RunnerView partitions branches into two render loops
- All 11 v1.4 requirements satisfied; milestone audit re-passed after Phase 30 retroactive verification + Phase 29 live-vault UAT closure + Phase 31 UAT 5/5
- Known deferred tech debt: Nyquist VALIDATION.md still in draft for phases 28–31 (matches existing v1.2 retroactive-Nyquist backlog entry)

## v1.3 Interactive Placeholder Editor (Shipped: 2026-04-12)

**Phases completed:** 1 phase (27), 1 plan  
**Timeline:** 2026-04-12 (single day, ~3.5 hours)  
**Git:** 17 commits, 2 source files, +266 lines (snippet-manager-view.ts +172, styles.css +94)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Phase 27: Replaced expandable row list with chip-based placeholder UI — type-coloured left bar (PH_COLOR), human-readable label, type badge, drag handle, remove button (CHIP-01)
- Phase 27: HTML5 native drag-and-drop reorder with 6-event DnD per chip, correct splice pattern, dragleave child-flicker guard (CHIP-02)
- Phase 27: `autoSaveAfterDrop()` persists reordered array via `snippetService.save()` — SnippetFillInModal tab order follows persisted order at zero modal changes (CHIP-03)
- Phase 27: UUID guard in `autoSaveAfterDrop()` prevents saving unsaved drafts; 25 automated Vitest tests cover DnD guard conditions, splice algorithm, and UUID guard
- Code review found 5 issues (WR-01–05); all fixed and verified; 5/5 UAT passed in live Obsidian
